# TAPLE FFI
TAPLE (pronounced T+üçé ['tap…ôl]) stands for Tracking (Autonomous) of Provenance and Lifecycle Events. TAPLE is a permissioned DLT solution for traceability of assets and processes. It is:

- **Scalable**: Scaling to a sufficient level for traceability use cases. 
- **Light**: Designed to support resource constrained devices.
- **Flexible**: Have a flexible and adaptable cryptographic scheme mechanism for a multitude of scenarios.
- **Energy-efficient**: Rust powered, TAPLE is sustainable and efficient from the point of view of energy consumption.

TAPLE FFI allows the execution of TAPLE nodes in environments and languages other than Rust.

## Build
Minimium supported rust versi√≥n (MSRV) is 1.67.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-ffi.git
$ cd taple-ffi
$ sudo apt install -y libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler cmake
$ cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
$ ./scripts/android/setup-android.sh
$ ./scripts/android/start-android.sh
```

**NOTE**: Rust Nightly is needed for iOS compilation. In this case, the last two commands must be replaced:

```bash
$ ./scripts/ios/setup-ios.sh
$ ./scripts/ios/start-ios.sh
```

## Usage
Examples of how to use the resulting SDK can be found in these repositories:
